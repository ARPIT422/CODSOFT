# Project Description
## 1. To-do List  
### Creating a to-do list in Python can be achieved using various approaches, but here's a brief description of a simple console-based to-do list application:

#### 1.Design the Data Structure: Decide on the data structure you want to use to store the to-do list items. One common choice is a list or array, where each element represents a single to-do item.
#### 2.Create Functions: Define functions to handle different actions that a user can perform with the to-do list, such as adding an item, removing an item, displaying the list, etc.
#### 4.User Interface: Create a simple text-based interface to interact with the to-do list. You can use loops and input prompts to receive user commands and display the to-do list accordingly.
#### 5.Implement the To-Do List: Now, put all the pieces together. Start the program with an empty to-do list and keep it running in a loop until the user decides to quit. Inside the loop, prompt the user for actions (e.g., add, remove, display, quit) and perform the corresponding operations based on their inputs.
