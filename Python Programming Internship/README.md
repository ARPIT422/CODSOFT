# Project Description
## 1. [To-do List](https://github.com/ARPIT422/CODSOFT/blob/main/Python%20Programming%20Internship/To-do%20List.py) 
### Creating a to-do list in Python can be achieved using various approaches, but here's a brief description of a simple console-based to-do list application:

#### 1.Design the Data Structure: Decide on the data structure you want to use to store the to-do list items. One common choice is a list or array, where each element represents a single to-do item.
#### 2.Create Functions: Define functions to handle different actions that a user can perform with the to-do list, such as adding an item, removing an item, displaying the list, etc.
#### 4.User Interface: Create a simple text-based interface to interact with the to-do list. You can use loops and input prompts to receive user commands and display the to-do list accordingly.
#### 5.Implement the To-Do List: Now, put all the pieces together. Start the program with an empty to-do list and keep it running in a loop until the user decides to quit. Inside the loop, prompt the user for actions (e.g., add, remove, display, quit) and perform the corresponding operations based on their inputs.

## 3. [Quiz Game](https://github.com/ARPIT422/CODSOFT/blob/main/Python%20Programming%20Internship/Quiz%20Game.py)
### Creating an MCQ (Multiple Choice Question) quiz game using the tkinter library in Python involves building a graphical user interface (GUI) to display questions, options, and track the user's answers. Here's a brief description of the steps involved:

#### 1. Import the Required Libraries: First, import the necessary libraries. You'll need tkinter for creating the GUI and other standard Python modules for handling the quiz logic.

#### 2. Create the GUI: Use tkinter to design the GUI. Create labels to display the question, radio buttons for options, buttons for navigating through questions, and a label to show the final score.

#### 4. Prepare Quiz Questions: Prepare a list of quiz questions, along with their options and correct answers. You can use a list of dictionaries or a data structure to store this information.

#### 5. Implement Quiz Logic: Write the logic to track the user's answers, calculate the score, and display the final score. Connect the buttons and radio buttons to appropriate functions to handle user input and navigation.

#### 6. Display Questions and Get User Input: Show the questions and options one by one, and capture the user's selection using radio buttons.

#### 7. Check Answers and Calculate Score: After the user completes the quiz or chooses to submit their answers, compare their selections with the correct answers and calculate the score.

#### 8. Show the Final Score: Display the final score to the user, along with an option to restart the quiz if desired.
